Iâ€™m Yuki Fang, a Masterâ€™s student in Integrated Marketing Communications at Northwestern University, specializing in Data and Marketing Analytics. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Economics and Data Science from NYU Abu Dhabi.

At Northwestern Medill, I focus on delivering data-driven marketing solutions that drive measurable impact. Iâ€™ve used tools like SQL, R, Tableau, and Google Analytics to uncover customer trends, evaluate campaign performance, and build dashboards that inform strategic decisions across industries.

Iâ€™m a detail-oriented problem solver with a strong sense of ownership and a passion for transforming complex data into clear, actionable strategies. Iâ€™m especially excited by the intersection of data, business, and marketingâ€”where analytical precision meets creative insight to move brands forward.
