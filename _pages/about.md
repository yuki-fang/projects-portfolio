## About Me
Hi, I’m Yuki Fang, a Master’s student in Integrated Marketing Communications at Northwestern University, specializing in Data and Marketing Analytics. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Economics and Data Science from NYU Abu Dhabi.

At Northwestern Medill, I focus on delivering data-driven marketing solutions that drive measurable impact. I’ve used tools like SQL, R, Tableau, and Google Analytics to uncover customer trends, evaluate campaign performance, and build dashboards that inform strategic decisions across industries.

I’m a detail-oriented problem solver with a strong sense of ownership and a passion for transforming complex data into clear, actionable strategies. I’m especially excited by the intersection of data, business, and marketing—where analytical precision meets creative insight to move brands forward.
